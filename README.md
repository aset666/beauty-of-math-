❤️ Love Function Animation

A short mathematical art project combining math, creativity, and animation.
This project draws and animates a "love curve" using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
It symbolizes love for mathematics and can even be used as a romantic gift for someone special.

📌 About the Project

This project creates an animated plot of a custom "LOVE(x)" function:

𝐿
𝑂
𝑉
𝐸
(
𝑥
)
=
𝑥
2
3
+
𝑒
3
(
𝜋
−
𝑥
2
)
⋅
sin
⁡
(
𝑎
𝜋
𝑥
)
LOVE(x)=x
3
2
	​

+
3
e
	​

(π−x
2
)
	​

⋅sin(aπx)

The animation changes the parameter a, causing the heart-shaped curve to “beat” like a real heart.

It generates a GIF:

love.gif

✨ Features

Animated mathematical visualization

Smooth heartbeat-like motion

Colorful romantic theme

Created entirely with Python

Outputs a GIF animation

Great as a fun project, portfolio piece, or a gift for someone you care about ❤️

📦 Requirements

Install the necessary libraries:

pip install matplotlib numpy


You also need FFmpeg installed on your system (matplotlib uses it to save GIFs).

▶️ How to Run

Save the script as heart.py

Run the file:

python heart.py


The script will generate:

love.gif


The animation will also appear in a Matplotlib window.

📜 Code Explanation

NumPy generates x-coordinates

The mathematical formula computes y

Matplotlib animates the curve

FuncAnimation updates the function for each frame

FFmpeg is used to save the animation as a GIF

💖 Meaning

This project is a symbolic blend of mathematics and emotion.
You can use it to express:

Love for math

Love for creativity

Love for a specific person
